## What is ESP32?
ESP32 is a series of low-cost, low-power system on a chip microcontrollers with integrated Wi-Fi and dual-mode Bluetooth.
## What is used for?
ESP32 can perform as a complete standalone system or as a slave device to a host MCU, reducing communication stack overhead on the main application processor.
## ESP32 Vs Arduino
While there are several differences between *Arduino* and *Esp32* boards, a few of the biggest are: 
- **Price**
- **Clock rate**
- **Connectivity:** most *Arduino* boards don't have Wi-Fi or Bluetooth functionality on their own. On the other hand, *Esp32* boards has Wi-Fi capabilities. which makes the Esp32 more suitable for ***IoT*** projects
